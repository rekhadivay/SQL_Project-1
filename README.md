# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
While working with sales_reports,products,all_sessions,analytics and sales_by_sku tables for Transforming and Analyzing Data with SQL Project, our main goals are to find important information, make things work better, and choose the right actions. 
We look for trends and patterns in the data and spot any unusual things.If something strange happens in the data, we want to notice it.
By analysing various aspects of user visits,visit numbers,user interaction  and their impact on sales and engagement metrics,
the project aims to increase revenue. We figure out which products sell the most and make the most money.
We also understand what products people like on the website, how much time they spend. 
Utilize the date column for time-series analysis to identify trends and seasonality in user behavior and sales.
Finally, we make the data more suitable for studying and modeling.
